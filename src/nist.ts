/**
 * Within this code we use the following nomenclature:
 * A "hash" isn't a hash in the sense of sha256 or whatever; it is simply a condensed representation for use in rendering.
 * A Family is the higher level grouping of NIST vulnerabilies. EG: AC, AU, AT, etc.
 * A Category is the subgrouping of Family. EG: AC-3, PM-15, etc.
 * A NistHash is a large record containing information about many families, and by extension their categories

 * Clearly "Empty" is the lowest precedence, as adding any control would wipe it out.
 * Following we have "From Profile" since it is in some way the absence of status, but also lacks run context.
 * Next, "Not Applicable" since it means that though we ran we don't care about the result
 * "Not Reviewed" implies that had the test run it would've mattered, but it was skipped deliberately
 * "No Data" is similarly a lack of result, but in this case unexpected, and thus worthy of more scrutiny
 * "Passed" means that a test passed! But "Failed" should override, since fails are really what we're looking for
 * Finally, "Profile Errors" mean something is broken and needs to be fixed, and thus overrides all
 * 
 * Returns:
 * < 0  if a < b (by the above criteria)
 * 0    if a === b
 * > 0  if a > b
